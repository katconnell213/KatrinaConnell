        <p id="bio">Hello! My name is Katrina.  I am curly-haired girl originally from South Jersey, USA.  I am an experimental linguist,
           an eye-tracking researcher, and Tobii Research Scientist.  I specialize in data analysis and experimental research methods & design. 
            In my own work, I study how second language learners acquire suprasegmental features of speech that are used to recognize 
            words in spoken speech, such as lexical tones. Currently, I work for Tobii, a company that makes eye trackers for academic and business research.
            I train those who buy a Tobii track on how to use it and the software, and I help those who have already started with experimental design, 
            best eye tracking practices and data exportation and analysis. I still maintain a research profile in the field of Lingusitics, and may run into you at a conference! </p>

                              I am particularly interested in how we learn to utilize new features of speech to recognize words 
                              in a second language, such as English speakers learning to use Chinese tone to distinguish words 
                              in Chinese.

      <h2>My Research</h2>
   

      <button class="emphbox"style="margin: 10px;">
        <p>   How do listeners recognise a spoken word?</p>
      </button>
                  <p>You may be thinking, "Don't you just hear the word and match it to something in memory?"  
                    While this may be true, it is not nearly the whole story.  </p>
                  <p>Speech recognition is <span id = "emphasis">incremental</span> in nature.  This means, 
                    you don't wait to hear the end of the word before you start trying to find it in memory. </p> 
                  
                  <p>As soon as you hear a sound, your mind starts flipping though it's mental dictionary looking 
                    for something, anything, that matches that input. As you hear more and more of the word, you can 
                    narrow in on the correct word. </p>
                  
                  <img src="./resources/LexicalAccess.gif" height="100px" width=“200px”>
  
                  <p>Learning about this process in my early career made me ask a followup question that has lead 
                    me down my path of research... </p>
  
                  <button class="emphbox"style="margin: 10px;">
                    <p> How do we learn to recognize spoken words in our second language?</p>
                  </button>
                  <p>How do we learn what is relevant to narrow down that list?  The process that is so effortless in our first language, suddenly becomes very difficult in a
                     second language. This is especially true when the languages differ greatly, such as between English 
                     and Chinese. How do we learn what is relevant to narrow down that list?  My research investigates how learners of 
                     a language navigate this process with the hope of improving language education. </p>

    <h2>My Training and Teaching </h2>
    <p> One of the best parts about the work that I do is sharing what I have learned with the next generation of researchers.
      Nothing makes happier than showing someone the one trick they needed to make something work or the time saving 
      method to complete a large task in record time.  I love sharing skills with people and seeing them take it and run 
      with it.  <br>
